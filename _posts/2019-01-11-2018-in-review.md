2018 was yet another awesome year.

## Commitments in work

I worked on building mobile development foundation.

### Jenkins CI Exapansion

I read [this book](https://amzn.to/2sDcqm7) to learn Jenkins(written in Japanese).
Aside from maintaining jenkins, I learned to modify several Jenkins modules, such as Git plugin.(We are using my forked Git plugin now.)

### Open API Specification

[OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/)

## Side projects

### This blog

I moved this blog to [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=5f4b41dbdb0e009af64882ea35ee82ecf0ef0290).
What I exactly did is that I moved my blog on docker on Linode instance.

How do I use Docker?

I introduced [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) on my instance.
If you are looking for the platform you can deploy easily, Dokku is the best option for you.

### Kiri

Kiri(霧 in Kanji) is my network abstraction layer in Swift. It's influenced by [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya).
If you are used to Moya, you will notice Kiri is very similar to Moya.

Mastodon is promising for me.
