Today I upgraded Jekyll to 4.0.0.

This is my note from this migration.

The only issue that I encountered is deployment on netlify.
I am making use of netlify for staging testing.

Currently default Ruby version on netlify is 2.3.6. However, jekyll4 requires Ruby > 2.4.0.
But no worry. There is a workaround.

    We also recommend specifying a version of Ruby that matches your build environment. You can set a Ruby version via a /.ruby-version file. You must choose from among rvmâ€™s supported versions.

from https://www.netlify.com/docs/#helpful-hints

If you don't have `.ruby-version` file in your project, it's recommended to put it on the project root.

And one more thing that you should note, use Bundler1(1.7.3) on your local.

Bundler2 is not available in netlify environment. It fails to build if your Gemfile.lock is associated with Bundler2.

That's it. Enjoy blogging!!
