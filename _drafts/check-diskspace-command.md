You can easily see how much you consume disk volume.

    du -h -d 1

* `-h` means "Human-readable" output.
* `-d` means depth. Now I specify depth 1.

You can check your entire disk information by running this command.

    df -h



## Motivation

I am annoyed of disk space shortness. I am using Mac mini to build my products continuously. So workspace and artifacts takes huge spaces.
