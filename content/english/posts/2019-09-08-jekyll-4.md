Today I upgraded Jekyll to 4.0.0.
This is my note from this migration.

---

The only issue that I encountered is deployment on netlify.
I am making use of netlify for staging testing.

There are 2 **version**s that you may consider when you are also a netlify user.

## Ruby Version

Currently default Ruby version on netlify is 2.3.6. However, Jekyll 4 requires Ruby > 2.4.0.
But no worry. There is a workaround.

    We also recommend specifying a version of Ruby that matches your build environment. You can set a Ruby version via a /.ruby-version file. You must choose from among rvmâ€™s supported versions.

from [https://www.netlify.com/docs/#helpful-hints](https://www.netlify.com/docs/#helpful-hints)

If you don't have `.ruby-version` file in your project yet, it's recommended to put it on the project root.

## Bundler Version

And one more thing that you should note, use Bundler1(1.7.3) on your local.

Bundler2 is not available in netlify build environment. It fails to build if your Gemfile.lock is associated with Bundler2, since `bundle` is not found.

That's it. Enjoy blogging!!
