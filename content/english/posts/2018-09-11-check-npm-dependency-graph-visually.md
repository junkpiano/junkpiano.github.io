title: Check npm dependency graph visually
---

I found the awesome tool to visualize npm dependency graph.

This example shows dependency graph of `react-native-maps`, which I was investigating last night.

## 2D

You can drag nodes, and highlight node with cursor on.

## 3D

You can rotate graph, but 3D doesn't show module names.
